# HeCiX:  Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models for Biomedical Research
Despite advancements in drug development strategies, 90%
of clinical trials fail. This suggests overlooked aspects in target validation
and drug optimization. In order to address this, we introduce HeCiXKG, Hetionet-Clinicaltrials neXus Knowledge Graph, a novel fusion of
data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet in a single knowledge graph.
HeCiX-KG combines data on previously conducted clinical trials from
ClinicalTrials.gov, and domain expertise on diseases and genes from Hetionet. This offers a thorough resource for clinical researchers. Further, we
introduce HeCiX, a system that uses LangChain to integrate HeCiX-KG
with GPT-4, and increase its usability. HeCiX shows high performance
during evaluation against a range of clinically relevant issues, proving
this model to be promising for enhancing the effectiveness of clinical research. Thus, this approach provides a more holistic view of clinical trials
and existing biological data.
